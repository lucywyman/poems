		<h2>Why I love(d) Andy Baldwin</h2>
		<p>1. I can tell him absolutely anything and he will not judge me, make fun of me, or bring it up later to make the point that I'm a terrible person.  
<br>2. I don't have to remember which things I've told him and which things I haven't.
<br>3. He loves me unconditionally.  I'm not even sure my parents do that...
<br>4. He's a really intelligent and thoughtful human being.
<br>5. Which makes for interesting and endless conversations.  He's the kind of person I can talk to for five hours, go home, and continue texting until midnight.
<br>6. He accepts my many faults without resenting me for having them.
<br>7. He's one of the kindest people I've ever met.
<br>8. He knows all the worst things about me, but still sees the best in me
<br>9. He wears bowties and fedoras, other people's opinions be damned.
<br>10. He's a bag of ants.
<br>11.  He is super Smart with a capital S but not in that annoying way where he's smart just for the sake of being smart or to get good grades or rub it in people's face like Henry Harding but because he actually just loves knowledge.
<br>12. He defends my mom at Speech and Debate tournaments when kids make fun of her eating.
<br>13. He puts up with my father 
<br>14. He's super good at cuddling.  Like...expert level cuddler.
<br>15. Every time we disagree about something we discuss it until we realize that we actually agree with each other.
<br>16. He’ll talk to me until two in the morning. Even when we aren’t on speaking terms.
<br>17. He’s passionate, and inspires others to be passionate.
<br>18. He’s the first person I think about when I wake up, and the last person I think about before falling asleep.
<br>19. He’s forgiving.</p>
