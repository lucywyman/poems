	<h2>A Love Letter to California</h2>
	<p>I think I fall in love too often
	<br>Or...think about falling in love too often
	<br>Thinking too fast
	<br>or falling too fast
	<br>I’m not sure which
	<br>I think I love you
	<br>I think about lying in your arms as I lay in someone else’s
	<br>I think about thinking about you when there’s nothing else to fill the space
	<br>You were my ecstasy, six days of high for six weeks of 
	<br>utter helplessness and
	<br>I wish that I was stronger
	<br>that I could beat this addiction to a chemical reaction
	<br>that to you I was more than just a sexual transaction
	<br>When I said I wanted to experiment with drugs this wasn’t what I meant.
	<br>I didn’t mean to be intoxicated by your smile
	<br>Or get high on stardust as we lay beneath the moon
	<br>I never imagined myself pulling my sleeve down, trying to hide the scars you left from my friends
	<br>becoming a junkie
	<br>but the feeling of you rushing through my veins left me breathless
	<br>always craving more, until more was never enough, but...
	<br>
	<br>But I guess it’s true what they say
	<br>that the best laid plans of mice and men often go astray
	<br>and in a way it’s been a blessing
	<br>a reminder that for every high there’s a low
	<br>that there are a thousand people who feel this way too,
	<br>That I am still human
	<br>my heart is still beating
	<br>a reminder that I will always have good friends, chai tea and spongebob squarepants
	<br>that this life is beautiful
	<br>and that you don’t need a hit to enjoy it.
