<h2>All the Things I Meant to Say</h2>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">I wish I could find enough pretty words to put my thoughts about you into</div>
<div class="line">That there were tangible letters that could give structure to the ways in which you</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">inspire, irritate, amaze, and irk me.</div>
</div>
<div class="line">But, most days, words just feel like numbers on a ruler</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">islands in a sea</div>
<div class="line">and you are everything in between</div>
<div class="line">an uncharted ocean and a millimeter of wooden space</div>
</div>
<div class="line">And like trying to save a moment in a mason jar</div>
<div class="line">or catch smoke with a butterfly net</div>
<div class="line">I find it impossible to capture you in something so finite as a paragraph</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">I keep having the urge to say &quot;I love you&quot;</div>
<div class="line">I can feel the words in my throat,</div>
<div class="line">bubbles of air coming up</div>
<div class="line">bursting in my mouth like pop rocks</div>
<div class="line">before they can reach your ear</div>
<div class="line">but I know that isn't what I want to say.</div>
<div class="line">What I mean is that I care very much about you.</div>
<div class="line">But that sounds tired, like a mother trying to connect with her rebellious teenager</div>
<div class="line">Maybe what I really mean is that it feels good to be with you,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">to have someone to share the mundane details of my life with</div>
</div>
<div class="line">It feels good to have someone to look forward to seeing, to</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">try to understand,</div>
<div class="line">to send little less-than-threes</div>
<div class="line">and wish sweet dreams.</div>
</div>
<div class="line">But even that sounds too temporary and impulsive,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">like you're a drug I'm experimenting with in college because</div>
<div class="line">it's fun, and I have my whole life to wake up early and go to work.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<div class="line">The most honest answer is that I'm lonely, and you're there.</div>
<div class="line">And I love where we are right now.</div>
<div class="line">Somewhere in that millimeter of wooden space</div>
<div class="line">We are pure potential</div>
<div class="line">We are a plane ticket to anywhere</div>
<div class="line">Two kids, standing onstage holding diplomas, with a lifetime of possibiity ahead of us.</div>
<div class="line">We are the anticipation of the kiss</div>
<div class="line">The first peek of the roller coaster</div>
<div class="line">The opening credits of the movie</div>
<div class="line">We are every imaginable storyline that begins with</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">&quot;One day, a boy met a girl&quot;</div>
</div>
<div class="line">And I love that.</div>
<div class="line">I love that I could wake up next to you ten years from now</div>
<div class="line">That our bodies could still curl perfectly around each other</div>
<div class="line">That I might never again wish I was another person, part of another</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">couple, or wonder what could be if I was just ten pounds thinner</div>
</div>
<div class="line">I love the look our friends will give us when they see our lips touch</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">like they knew all along, and were just waiting for us to figure</div>
<div class="line">it out.</div>
</div>
<div class="line">I love that I would never have to wonder if I could have done better.</div>
<div class="line">I know that this blissful moment of possibility won't last forever,</div>
<div class="line">That we can't stay here indefinitely.</div>
<div class="line">Inevitably, the movie ends</div>
<div class="line">the roller coaster comes down</div>
<div class="line">everything that could have been collapses into reality</div>
<div class="line">flies past us at breakneck speed</div>
<div class="line">and everyone goes home</div>
<div class="line">But I want to hold on to the possibilities</div>
<div class="line">To everything that we could be</div>
<div class="line">Just a little bit longer.</div>
</div>
