	<h2>On being homesick</h2>
	<p>I miss you
	<br>I miss you like a retired school teacher misses the sound of children laughing
	<br>I miss you like a model misses eating oreos
	<br>like a bed misses having two people in it
	<br>like the Ottoman empire misses existing
	<br>I miss you like a first year college student misses home
	<br>and like a twenty-something with a Ph.D in business relations misses his mom’s homemade spaghetti
	<br>I miss you like summer misses the snow
	<br>like today misses yesterday
	<br>I miss you like a paraplegic misses being able to open the door for people
	<br>like Batman misses his parents
	<br>like you miss fireflies and thunderstorms.
	<br>I miss you like a factory worker misses the two finger’s he lost in the paper mill
	<br>I miss you like a seven year old misses his front tooth.
	<br>I miss you like missing air when you’ve been underwater for too long, and your lungs start to burn, but you’re still too far from the surface
	<br>I miss you like a mailbox misses letters on sundays
	<br>I miss you like an army wife misses her husband, always afraid that this will be the last time she talks to him
	<br>like a prisoner misses being able to see the moon at night
	<br>And I know you don’t want to talk to me but my point here is that I miss you
	<br>A lot
