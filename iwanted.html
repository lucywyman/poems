		<h2>On being in love</h2>
		<p>I wanted to write you a love poem, but
<br>Then I realized that there aren't enough words in the dictionary
<br>To describe the way it feels to be in your arms.
<br>I realized that the definition of love doesn't say that you're the first thing I think about each morning, the last one I think about each night and that everything in between is spent dreaming
<br>
<br>I wanted to write you a love poem, but
<br>You see, if words were integers our love would be everything in between: multiples of  i, and pi, 
<br>and cosine of nine
<br>And no matter how close you come to those integers, baby, it's still just rounding.
<br>And that just isn't the same.
<br>
<br>I wanted to write a poem about you.
<br>But before I could, I started crying, overwhelmed by how much you mean to me.
<br>I was going to write my poem in tears, hoping that if I could write it in raw emotions the words wouldn't get in the way
<br>Then I realized you can't read something written in tears.
<br>
<br>I wanted to write you a love poem
<br>To tell you that you get my heart, and my mind, and this world gets the rest of me
<br>Just so that you'll always see the best in  me
<br>And know that everything I do
<br>Has a little bit of you in it too.
<br>Someone once told me that a physicist sees the physics in everything, a chemist sees only the 
chemistry
<br>But love, all that I can see is you.
<br>
<br>I was having trouble writing you a love poem
<br>So I decided to write you a song, instead
<br>For what is a song but a poem, spoken to the rhythm of our accelerating breath 
<br>But then I realized I couldn't replicate the beating of your heart with a drum, 
<br>That a guitar could never sound like the melody of your voice as you whisper in my ear that you 
love me
<br>
<br>So you see.
<br>I wanted to write a poem about you.
<br>But I just couldn't find the words.
