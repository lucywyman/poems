	<h2>On Unrequitted Love</h2>
	<p>
	I watch the way his mouth moves to form words<br>
	So that the first time we kiss his lips will already be as familiar as the sound of his voice<br>
	Like driving to high school again--natural, almost instinctual<br>
	As if we've done this a hundred times before.<br><br>
	I watch the way his hands grip a pencil<br>

	But there's so much to hate too<br>
	Each time he asks "Why doesn't she like me?", dismayed by rejection<br>
	Is a sucker punch to the gut<br>
	Making it hard to breath<br>
	His own questions echoing mine<br>
	Each of us wishing we were a little smarter, a little funnier, looked a little better naked<br>
	Feeding the illusion that these would make any kind of difference<br>
	Allow us to avert our gaze from the uncomfortable truth<br>
	<!--Just repeat<br>
	"Maybe it's that you aren't pretty enough, or smart enough, or that you talk about wanting to be with him too much.<br>
	Maybe you just know each other too well-he's seen the crazy, the tired, the sad, and it's not worth it."-->
	"You aren't good enough"<br><br>
	I hate that there's a line I can't cross<br>
	That I have to swallow the words "I love you" each time we part ways<br>
	That I fall asleep alone<br>
	Maintain an air of casualty and nonchalance as he tells me he loves her<br>
	This other woman, with the most important person in my life wrapped around her finger<br>
	Not gonna lie, it's a little hard to handle.<br>
