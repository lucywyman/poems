<h3>On being in love</h3>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">I wanted to write you a love poem, but</div>
<div class="line">Then I realized that there aren't enough words in the dictionary</div>
<div class="line">To describe the way it feels to be in your arms.</div>
<div class="line">I realized that the definition of love doesn't say that you're the first thing I think about each morning, the last one I think about each night and that everything in between is spent dreaming</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">I wanted to write you a love poem, but</div>
<div class="line">You see, if words were integers our love would be everything in between: multiples of  i, and pi,</div>
<div class="line">and cosine of nine</div>
<div class="line">And no matter how close you come to those integers, baby, it's still just rounding.</div>
<div class="line">And that just isn't the same.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">I wanted to write a poem about you.</div>
<div class="line">But before I could, I started crying, overwhelmed by how much you mean to me.</div>
<div class="line">I was going to write my poem in tears, hoping that if I could write it in raw emotions the words wouldn't get in the way</div>
<div class="line">Then I realized you can't read something written in tears.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">I wanted to write you a love poem</div>
<div class="line">To tell you that you get my heart, and my mind, and this world gets the rest of me</div>
<div class="line">Just so that you'll always see the best in  me</div>
<div class="line">And know that everything I do</div>
<div class="line">Has a little bit of you in it too.</div>
<div class="line">Someone once told me that a physicist sees the physics in everything, a chemist sees only the</div>
<div class="line">chemistry</div>
<div class="line">But love, all that I can see is you.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">I was having trouble writing you a love poem</div>
<div class="line">So I decided to write you a song, instead</div>
<div class="line">For what is a song but a poem, spoken to the rhythm of our accelerating breath</div>
<div class="line">But then I realized I couldn't replicate the beating of your heart with a drum,</div>
<div class="line">That a guitar could never sound like the melody of your voice as you whisper in my ear that you</div>
<div class="line">love me</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">So you see.</div>
<div class="line">I wanted to write a poem about you.</div>
<div class="line">But I just couldn't find the words.</div>
