	<h2>On becoming a mother</h2>
	<p>I can’t really say it’s logical,
	<br>Or that my reasons are methodical
	<br>All I can say is...
	<br>
	<br>I want to have a baby
	<br>Not right here, not right now
	<br>but somehow
	<br>I just can’t imagine going through life without looking down and seeing my entire world in my arms.
	<br>
	<br>How can I explain what it would mean to create something so beautiful with someone I love.
	<br>More than we could ever do with our own two hands, a synthesis of our souls, 
	<br>So much greater than the sum of our individual parts,
	<br>He’ll have my laugh and your ambition, and
	<br>When we take him to the park he’ll ask question after question.
	<br>Wondering why green means go and how clouds make snow
	<br>And when he’s going to grow
	<br>Up, so that he can be as tall as daddy is.
	<br>
	<br>How can I possibly justify 
	<br>wanting to say “She has her father’s eyes
	<br>not just in their shape and color but in the way they light up when she talks about fireflies
	<br>and poetry
	<br>and when she looks up at me and says “mommy”
	<br>That moment will mean more to me
	<br>than any prize or college degree 
	<br>you see... 
	<br>
	<br>I want to have a baby girl, so that I can see a little bit of me in everything she does.
	<br>So that she can grow up to be everything I never could
	<br>An astronaut or Robin Hood
	<br>And I’ll teach her to see the good
	<br>and bad in everything, including herself
	<br>I’ll teach her that she is a strong, independent woman who don’t need no man
	<br>but occasionally needs to cry, and be told that everything is going to be alright.
	<br>
	<br>I want to have a baby boy, 
	<br>And when they hand him to me at the hospital, the nurse will nod and say “This one’s a lover”.
	<br>She’s seen a million and one who are “gonna go far” or “Bound for something greater”
	<br>But when people see this boy, something in their gut will make them feel a little braver.
	<br>He will be the light at the end of the tunnel
	<br>The arms when you need to cuddle
	<br>The breath when life has become a struggle
	<br>Yes, my baby boy is going to redefine what it means to be a man
	<br>
	<br>So, call me selfish, call me crazy
	<br>All I know is...
	<br>
	<br>I want to have a baby
	<br>Not right here, not right now
	<br>but somehow
	<br>I just can’t imagine going through life without looking down and seeing my entire world in my arms.
