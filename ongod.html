	<h2>On God</h2>
	<p>Hail Mary, full of grace
	<br>Keep me safe in your embrace
	<br>When did life become this race 
	<br>of who could wear the shortest skirts 
	<br>and tightest shirts 
	<br>and still be a virgin, chaste
	<br>Like you?
	<br>
	<br>Amazing Grace
	<br>How sweet the sound
	<br>that condemned a wretch like me
	<br>Whose holy words
	<br>Left mine unheard
	<br>as though this were a travesty
	<br>That bore the cross
	<br>on my breast embossed
	<br>a red A for adultery
	<br>
	<br>Our father, who art in heaven
	<br>I know I’m already seventeen 
	<br>but Lord I just can’t understand why my mother’s so ashamed of me
	<br>Why the only thing that she can see
	<br>is not the love, or joy I felt, but the disgrace I brought on our family.
	<br>Why my friends look at me like an amputee
	<br>As if my virginity was a limb, now severed and lost
	<br>Why there’s an asterisk when they talk to me
	<br>the footnote reading “you slut” 
	<br>Why no one stood by me, but instead erected “Do not enter” signs,
	<br>closed their pearly gates
	<br>and made our once mutual friendships into one-way streets
	<br>Why there is no water holy enough to wash me clean of these sins
	<br>No martyr who can save me,
	<br>Why my father looks at me so judgmentally
	<br>his deflowered little girl, Lucy
	<br>Where did we go wrong?  
	<br>He asks.
	<br>And I don’t have to ask to know that I’m the mistake he’s talking about
	<br>Lord knows my parents never made love so consciously.
	<br>
	<br>Dear Father, hear this:
	<br>When I had sex for the first time, I was not deflowered
	<br>I was reborn.</p>
