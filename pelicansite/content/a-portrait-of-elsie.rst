A Portrait of Elsie
===================
:slug: elsie

| What would you say if I told you you were beautiful?
| If I said, out loud, to your face
| that you weren't every-day-is-a-good-hair-day beautiful,
| or still-gorgeous-without-make-up beautiful, or even
| that-dress-looks-perfect-on-you beautiful, but were instead
| that soul-crushing, heart-aching, bone-wrenching beautiful,
| I-can-see-God-through-your-burning-blue-eyes beautiful,
| the kind of beautiful that doesn't take your breath away, but makes
|       getting up in the morning a little bit easier.
| Would you believe me?
| 
| More than a beauty of youth or spinach salads, yours is a beauty of 
|       character
| Incapable of being captured in a painting or picture,
| There's no make-up that can mimic the concern that creases your forehead
|       when you ask "Are you ok?",
| No lotion to help you remember what my brother likes for breakfast
| Or give you the generosity to drive Ian to the bus station.
| There's so much grace in the way you move through life
| The determination with which you approached programming CPUs
| The temerity within your delicate figure
| That, like the sun, every moment you touch is made vivid
| As if life were a book, where details you would never 
|       noticed otherwise are described
| That time we sat in your car for an hour, finally able to shed the act
|       that we had our shit together all the time.
| That time we went to Sky High and ate brownies and cried.
| That time we had a serial cereals party
| That time we went, 
| That time we saw, we did, we felt. 
| 
| When I call you muse, I don't mean that you inspired
|       me to write this poem,
| Or imitate your beauty with brush strokes and finite words.
| But that you made me want to be a better person.
| To mirror your support, honesty, and kindness
| Return the love and security you give me.
| Elsie, when I look at you, more than soft hair or gorgeous legs
| I see the person I want to be when I grow up.
