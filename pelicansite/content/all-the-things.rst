All the Things I Meant to Say
=============================
:slug: all-the-things
:date: July 18, 2015

| I wish I could find enough pretty words to put my thoughts about you into
| That there were tangible letters that could give structure to the ways in which you
| 	inspire, irritate, amaze, and irk me.
| But, most days, words just feel like numbers on a ruler
| 	islands in a sea 
| 	and you are everything in between
| 	an uncharted ocean and a millimeter of wooden space
| And like trying to save a moment in a mason jar
| or catch smoke with a butterfly net
| I find it impossible to capture you in something so finite as a paragraph
| 
| I keep having the urge to say "I love you"
| I can feel the words in my throat,
| bubbles of air coming up
| bursting in my mouth like pop rocks
| before they can reach your ear
| but I know that isn't what I want to say.
| What I mean is that I care very much about you.
| But that sounds tired, like a mother trying to connect with her rebellious teenager
| Maybe what I really mean is that it feels good to be with you,
| 	to have someone to share the mundane details of my life with
| It feels good to have someone to look forward to seeing, to
| 	try to understand, 
| 	to send little less-than-threes
| 	and wish sweet dreams.
| But even that sounds too temporary and impulsive,
| 	like you're a drug I'm experimenting with in college because
| 	it's fun, and I have my whole life to wake up early and go to work.
| The most honest answer is that I'm lonely, and you're there.
| And I love where we are right now.
| Somewhere in that millimeter of wooden space
| We are pure potential
| We are a plane ticket to anywhere
| Two kids, standing onstage holding diplomas, with a lifetime of possibiity ahead of us.
| We are the anticipation of the kiss
| The first peak of the roller coaster
| The opening credits of the movie
| We are every imaginable storyline that begins with 
| 	"One day, a boy met a girl"
| And I love that. 
| I love that I could wake up next to you ten years from now
| That our bodies could still curl perfectly around each other
| That I might never again wish I was another person, part of another
| 	couple, or wonder what could be if I was just ten pounds thinner
| I love the look our friends will give us when they see our lips touch
| 	like they knew all along, and were just waiting for us to figure 
| 	it out.
| I love that I would never have to wonder if I could have done better.
| I know that this blissful moment of possibility won't last forever,
| That we can't stay here indefinitely.
| Inevitably, the movie ends
| the roller coaster comes down
| everything that could have been collapses into reality
| flies past us at breakneck speed
| and everyone goes home
| But I want to hold on to the possibilities
| To everything that we could be
| Just a little bit longer.
