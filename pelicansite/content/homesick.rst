On being homesick
=================
:slug: homesick
:type: poem
 
| I miss you
| I miss you like a retired school teacher misses the sound of children laughing
| I miss you like a model misses eating oreos
| like a bed misses having two people in it
| like the Ottoman empire misses existing
| I miss you like a first year college student misses home
| and like a twenty-something with a Ph.D in business relations misses his mom’s homemade spaghetti
| I miss you like summer misses the snow
| like today misses yesterday
| I miss you like a paraplegic misses being able to open the door for people
| like Batman misses his parents
| like you miss fireflies and thunderstorms.
| I miss you like a factory worker misses the two finger’s he lost in the paper mill
| I miss you like a seven year old misses his front tooth.
| I miss you like missing air when you’ve been underwater for too long, and your lungs start to burn, but you’re still too far from the surface
| I miss you like a mailbox misses letters on sundays
| I miss you like an army wife misses her husband, always afraid that this will be the last time she talks to him
| like a prisoner misses being able to see the moon at night
| And I know you don’t want to talk to me but my point here is that I miss you
| A lot
