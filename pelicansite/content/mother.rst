On becoming a mother
====================
:slug: mother

| I can’t really say it’s logical,
| Or that my reasons are methodical
| All I can say is...
| 
| I want to have a baby
| Not right here, not right now
| but somehow
| I just can’t imagine going through life without looking down and seeing my entire world in my arms.
| 
| How can I explain what it would mean to create something so beautiful with someone I love.
| More than we could ever do with our own two hands, a synthesis of our souls, 
| So much greater than the sum of our individual parts,
| He’ll have my laugh and your ambition, and
| When we take him to the park he’ll ask question after question.
| Wondering why green means go and how clouds make snow
| And when he’s going to grow
| Up, so that he can be as tall as daddy is.
| 
| How can I possibly justify 
| wanting to say “She has her father’s eyes
| not just in their shape and color but in the way they light up when she talks about fireflies
| and poetry
| and when she looks up at me and says “mommy”
| That moment will mean more to me
| than any prize or college degree 
| you see... 
| 
| I want to have a baby girl, so that I can see a little bit of me in everything she does.
| So that she can grow up to be everything I never could
| An astronaut or Robin Hood
| And I’ll teach her to see the good
| and bad in everything, including herself
| I’ll teach her that she is a strong, independent woman who don’t need no man
| but occasionally needs to cry, and be told that everything is going to be alright.
| 
| I want to have a baby boy, 
| And when they hand him to me at the hospital, the nurse will nod and say “This one’s a lover”.
| She’s seen a million and one who are “gonna go far” or “Bound for something greater”
| But when people see this boy, something in their gut will make them feel a little braver.
| He will be the light at the end of the tunnel
| The arms when you need to cuddle
| The breath when life has become a struggle
| Yes, my baby boy is going to redefine what it means to be a man
| 
| So, call me selfish, call me crazy
| All I know is...
| I want to have a baby
| Not right here, not right now
| but somehow
| I just can’t imagine going through life without looking down and seeing my entire world in my arms.
