Day 3: Ode to Tomato Soup
=========================
:slug: Ode to Tomato Soup
:nano:

Oh, Tomato Soup
You have always been tehre for me
Through thick and thin, you were there
Sometimes thick, sometimes thin, but always warm
(Except for that one time in the dorms, but I don't hold it against you)
Tomato Soup, you and your tireless sidekick Grilled Cheese
Are the very picture of perfection
Envied by all other culinary creations
Even Pizza cannot compete
