On being in love

:slug: love
:date: January 17, 2013

| I wanted to write you a love poem, but
| Then I realized that there aren't enough words in the dictionary
| To describe the way it feels to be in your arms.
| I realized that the definition of love doesn't say that you're the first thing I think about each morning, the last one I think about each night and that everything in between is spent dreaming
| 
| I wanted to write you a love poem, but
| You see, if words were integers our love would be everything in between: multiples of  i, and pi, 
| and cosine of nine
| And no matter how close you come to those integers, baby, it's still just rounding.
| And that just isn't the same.
| 
| I wanted to write a poem about you.
| But before I could, I started crying, overwhelmed by how much you mean to me.
| I was going to write my poem in tears, hoping that if I could write it in raw emotions the words wouldn't get in the way
| Then I realized you can't read something written in tears.
| 
| I wanted to write you a love poem
| To tell you that you get my heart, and my mind, and this world gets the rest of me
| Just so that you'll always see the best in  me
| And know that everything I do
| Has a little bit of you in it too.
| Someone once told me that a physicist sees the physics in everything, a chemist sees only the 
| chemistry
| But love, all that I can see is you.
| 
| I was having trouble writing you a love poem
| So I decided to write you a song, instead
| For what is a song but a poem, spoken to the rhythm of our accelerating breath 
| But then I realized I couldn't replicate the beating of your heart with a drum, 
| That a guitar could never sound like the melody of your voice as you whisper in my ear that you 
| love me
| 
| So you see.
| I wanted to write a poem about you.
| But I just couldn't find the words.
