<h3>On being homesick</h3>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">I miss you</div>
<div class="line">I miss you like a retired school teacher misses the sound of children laughing</div>
<div class="line">I miss you like a model misses eating oreos</div>
<div class="line">like a bed misses having two people in it</div>
<div class="line">I miss you like a first year college student misses home</div>
<div class="line">and like a twenty-something with a Ph.D in business relations misses his mom’s homemade spaghetti</div>
<div class="line">I miss you like summer misses the snow</div>
<div class="line">like today misses yesterday</div>
<div class="line">I miss you like a paraplegic misses being able to open the door for people</div>
<div class="line">like Batman misses his parents</div>
<div class="line">like you miss fireflies and thunderstorms.</div>
<div class="line">I miss you like a factory worker misses the two finger’s he lost in the paper mill</div>
<div class="line">I miss you like a seven year old misses his front tooth.</div>
<div class="line">I miss you like missing air when you’ve been underwater for too long, and your lungs start to burn, but you’re still too far from the surface</div>
<div class="line">I miss you like a mailbox misses letters on sundays</div>
<div class="line">I miss you like an army wife misses her husband, always afraid that this will be the last time she talks to him</div>
<div class="line">like a prisoner misses being able to see the moon at night</div>
<div class="line">And I know you don’t want to talk to me but my point here is that I miss you</div>
