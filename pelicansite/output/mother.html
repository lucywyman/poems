<h3>On becoming a mother</h3>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">I can’t really say it’s logical,</div>
<div class="line">Or that my reasons are methodical</div>
<div class="line">All I can say is...</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">I want to have a baby</div>
<div class="line">Not right here, not right now</div>
<div class="line">but somehow</div>
<div class="line">I just can’t imagine going through life without looking down and seeing my entire world in my arms.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">How can I explain what it would mean to create something so beautiful with someone I love.</div>
<div class="line">More than we could ever do with our own two hands, a synthesis of our souls,</div>
<div class="line">So much greater than the sum of our individual parts,</div>
<div class="line">He’ll have my laugh and your ambition, and</div>
<div class="line">When we take him to the park he’ll ask question after question.</div>
<div class="line">Wondering why green means go and how clouds make snow</div>
<div class="line">And when he’s going to grow</div>
<div class="line">Up, so that he can be as tall as daddy is.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">How can I possibly justify</div>
<div class="line">wanting to say “She has her father’s eyes</div>
<div class="line">not just in their shape and color but in the way they light up when she talks about fireflies</div>
<div class="line">and poetry</div>
<div class="line">and when she looks up at me and says “mommy”</div>
<div class="line">That moment will mean more to me</div>
<div class="line">than any prize or college degree</div>
<div class="line">you see...</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">I want to have a baby girl, so that I can see a little bit of me in everything she does.</div>
<div class="line">So that she can grow up to be everything I never could</div>
<div class="line">An astronaut or Robin Hood</div>
<div class="line">And I’ll teach her to see the good</div>
<div class="line">and bad in everything, including herself</div>
<div class="line">I’ll teach her that she is a strong, independent woman who don’t need no man</div>
<div class="line">but occasionally needs to cry, and be told that everything is going to be alright.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">I want to have a baby boy,</div>
<div class="line">And when they hand him to me at the hospital, the nurse will nod and say “This one’s a lover”.</div>
<div class="line">She’s seen a million and one who are “gonna go far” or “Bound for something greater”</div>
<div class="line">But when people see this boy, something in their gut will make them feel a little braver.</div>
<div class="line">He will be the light at the end of the tunnel</div>
<div class="line">The arms when you need to cuddle</div>
<div class="line">The breath when life has become a struggle</div>
<div class="line">Yes, my baby boy is going to redefine what it means to be a man</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">So, call me selfish, call me crazy</div>
<div class="line">All I know is...</div>
<div class="line">I want to have a baby</div>
<div class="line">Not right here, not right now</div>
<div class="line">but somehow</div>
<div class="line">I just can’t imagine going through life without looking down and seeing my entire world in my arms.</div>
