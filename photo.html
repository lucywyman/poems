	<h2>A photo of us</h2>
	<p>
	There exists only one picture of us together.  It was taken on a bus, by someone we didn’t know, simply because I had the camera with me.  He is leaning back towards me, his expression content, with the hint of a smirk on his lips--not a condescending smirk, but one that hints at the comfortable intimacy of our relationship.  I am in the middle of smiling for the camera, gripping the hand that is wrapped around my shoulder like a toddler holding on to a red carnival balloon.  My hair is frizzed, my make-up long since faded, and together we look like a couple; two people who are comfortable enough with each other that they don’t have to try to look happy or interesting.  There is nothing remarkable about the picture: we are another couple, on another bus, in another city.  We could be anybody.<br><br>
	I remember the day, though in the sense that it feels like another lifetime.  Our relationship went through many phases, the first of which was superficial and fleeting.  We only knew each other vicariously at first, as rumors and second hand information, and soaked in the mutual attention and admiration we gave each other, just happy that we were no longer alone.  Those first weeks were a flash of white light, each wanting to know more about the other.  We were downtown the day it was taken, wandering the streets, enjoying fall and each other’s company.   Three weeks later, we broke up.  This was the middle of Phase 1.
	The picture, like most, offers little insight into the lives of those it encaptures. There is no documentation of the first time we met: a party I had no intention of going to, a boy I had no intention of meeting, both of us oblivious to what the next year held for us.  There is no photograph of the way he looked at me that first time--sunlight from my bedroom window on his face, concern and excitement permeating his features, this being only the third time we had ever physically seen each other.   Nothing of him sitting on my front lawn, bite marks on his hand, begging for a place to stay the night, or of the two of us running down Stark street at 2:30 in the morning to go buy Kit-Kats, or of us embracing at the airport.   There is no recording of The Phone Call: “I’m thinking about killing myself. Goodbye.” <br><br> 
	They say that a picture is worth a thousand words, that this modern technology transcends verbal communication, a more effective method made for a more effective generation.  Like many technologies, the camera has become a staple of American life; indispensable (though not always in-disposable). As common and necessary as a cell phone. The camera has revolutionized the way we interact socially, and Imgur, Instagram, and Snapchat are altering the way we connect to each other, our society gravitating towards the visual, the visible, the tangible.  What do these pictures say about us?  More importantly, what can’t they say?  
	Despite these great advances in technology, Facebook still has the gall to ask me “Do you know Cassidy Moon?  Send him a friend request or message him.”</p><br>
