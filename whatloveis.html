	<h2>What love is (working title)</h2>
	<p>Some days, love is a kiss goodnight<br>
	Some days it's sunshine and ice cream and singing "In the Summertime, when the weather is high" with the windows rolled down<br>
	Or the text you get before your plane takes off<br>
	Some days love is the hand you feel on the small of your back<br>
	The smell of his hair on your clothes at the end of the day<br>
	The way he says "You look beautiful"<br>
	Some days love is saying "He was a jerk anyway"<br>
	And being there with gummy bears, tissues, and seasons 2-4 of Bridezillas<br>
	Or giving her the chocolate you brought to school because lord knows she needs it more than you do.<br>
	Some days, love is sitting next to someone in a movie theater and not holding their hand<br>
	Some days it's swallowing the words "I love you", and just being a friend<br>
	And holding your breath when they get too close because at least then you can focus on how bad your lungs are burning instead of how much you want to kiss them<br>
	Some days it's not speaking<br>
	Glancing down when you see the person you love across the room<br>
	Letting them extracate themself from your life<br>
	Some days love is convincing him to get out of bed in the morning and eat something<br>
	Others it's letting him sleep<br>
	Some days, love is the email you get after six months of silence that reads "I'm sorry I mistreated you"<br>
	Some days love says "I got you an adorable yellow dress for Easter.  I hope it fits.  I miss you."<br>
	My mom always told me that love was finding someone who didn't drive you nuts<br>
	While my dad always said there was no such thing as love<br>
	But I've found that neither of them were quite right.<br>
	Love is not always what we expect it to be.<br>
	It doesn't always come when we want it to<br>
	But it will always be there.<br>
